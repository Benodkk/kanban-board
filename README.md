## Project description

This project is a simple Kanban board system that allows users to manage their tasks in an intuitive and user-friendly way. Users can create new tasks, assign them to responsible people, set deadlines, and add short descriptions.

All tasks are displayed as cards on the Kanban board, where users can easily track their progress. Cards are placed in four columns - "To do", "In progress", "Testing" and "Finished" - depending on the state of completion of the task.

Users can easily move cards from one column to another to reflect progress. After completing a particular task stage, users can move the card to the next column on the board.
